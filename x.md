###  RISKs

- Current team is not willing or doesn't have the IT infrastructure: number of application, number of services, hardware, network topo..

- Physical location is far the center of city

### Build Ideas

**1. Mobile application to support leaders understand the current situation in everywhere, anytime**

  2. Student real-time statistic
  3. Cashflow

**2. Student App to see whole learning journey**

  - Subjects & Status
  - Subject agenda
  - Recommended materials
  - Lesson from previous students to pass the subject - advanced feature
  - Subject Score
  - Register a subject, payment
  - Rating teacher
  - Register a teacher for particular subject
  - Student can see teacher profile and previous rating by other students
  - Competency analysis (strong points, weak points & recommendation) - advanced feature
  - Ranking in the class
  - Learning Process statistic (Eg: 70% completed)

Some advanced analytics:

- Online users per day
- Total used open app per day
- Average used app per student per month 
- Most features used
- Most student majors used
- Journey & duration

**3. Parent App**

Who is the customer of X? the parent or student choice?

- Parent can see the score via mobile app - FREE
- Parent can see the score via SMS - FEE


**4. Lift jam**

- Possible issues: high traffic during some hour, during some subjects at the same time
- Level of building: For example 10 levels 
  - Identify which hour is more busy. Eg: 8-10am, 2-3pm
  - Root cause of issue: too many big subject happens in the same time, same floor
- Possible solution:
  1. 1/ Collect data and restructure subjects in the low-peak hour
  2. 2/ Optimize lift behavior
    - Identify most busy floor at peak hour
    - Low traffic floor can walk. Eg: In the low level (1, 2, 3) will walk during the peak hour
    - High traffic floor (Eg: floor 4-8):
      - Left lift: Allow to go to 4-5 floor only
      - Right lift: Allow to go to 6-10 floor only
